Handwritten Reminders is an iOS app that lets you create and manage reminders in your own handwriting using Apple Pencil. Instead of typing, you can handwrite your reminders directly on the screen, and each note is saved exactly as you wrote it. The app is designed to provide a more personal and creative way to organize your tasks.

In addition to handwritten reminders, the app aims to offer seamless integration with Apple’s Calendar and Reminders apps. You will be able to add your handwritten reminders directly to your system calendar or reminders list, making it easy to keep all your tasks and events in sync across your Apple devices. This integration allows you to view, edit, and complete reminders from both the Calendar and Reminders apps, ensuring you never miss an important task.

Key Features:
-Write reminders by hand with Apple Pencil and store them as handwritten notes
-Organize, edit, and delete reminders in a simple, intuitive interface
-Add reminders directly to the Apple Calendar and Reminders apps for full system integration
-View and manage all your tasks and events in one place

Handwritten Reminders combines the flexibility of handwritten notes with the power of Apple’s built-in productivity tools, helping you stay organized in a natural and efficient way.
